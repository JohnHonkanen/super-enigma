	         <hr />     	    

	         <p>Super-Enigma was developed by a 3 man team from the University of the West of Scotland for their 4th year project. Each member was given a task to research, develop and test.  All tasks were performed in an iterative basis. Development was completed using an agile-ish development methadology.

			      <h3>Our Process.</h3>	

			      <p> Our first step was for the team to establish a means of communication via discord, then study existing systems and software similar to "Super-Enigma". List of features and tasks that could be implemented were listed on a kanban board called Trello. Story points were assigned to each feature to determine the difficulty of implementing or completing each task. Tasks that were considered too hard was broken down, reworked or removed.
			      </p>

               <p>
               Once the feasibility of the project features was sufficiently detailed. The necessary software to develop the project was decided. In this projects case, as a group we decided to use a mixture of WebStorm, a smart JavaScript IDE by JetBrains, Sublime text for web development and Node.JS, an open-source JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser. 
               </p>

      		<div class="bgrid">

                <h3>Our Approach.</h3>

                <p>Development was done in an agile manner with continuous discussion and meetings to discuss the software design, testing idea's,
                    and making iterative changes to the general software design. Idea's that didn't work were studied, replaced or changed to fit
                    the project. Tasks were assigned to individuals's in an agile and fluid manner.
                </p>

               <p>
               Typically, we would recommend running two week sprint cycles. However for this project, sprint cycles were accelerated to a daily sprint
                   instead of two week to try to speed up development given the time constraints and the scale of the project. By running daily sprint
                   cycles we were able to accelerate the amount of features we could prototype and test. Release cycles were however run on a two week
                   basis to look at how to game looks after each release cycle.
               </p>

			     	<h3>Our Goal.</h3>	

			     	<p>Our short term goal for Super-Enigma is to create a real time strategy game in an agile-ish manner to explore the process of
                        working on a short sprint cycle while working on an agile-ish manner. The long term goal is to use Super-Enigma as a way to
                        prototype many different feature ideas to create a basic, yet fun game inspired by different RTS games while learning from
                        the process to iteratively improve the end product.
