	         <p>The story is made by the players experience. Each player starts out with one territory to expand to new territories, 
	         	defend existing ones and cutting off fresh reinforcements to existing enemy territories. Players may want to be 
	         	diplomatic in their approach when there are more than two players to avoid getting ganged up by all players at once.

	         <p>
				 See the Super-Enigma prototype demo in action <a href = "../index.html#portfolio">here</a>.

	         <h2>Features Implemented<span>.</span></h2>
	         	<p>
					<ul style = "list-style: circle">
						<li><h3>Basic Features:</h3></li>
							<ul style = "list-style-type:disc;">
								<li>Selecting territories: Any mouse click to select and interact with territories.</li>
								<li>Deselect territories: Right mouse click.</li>
								<li>Render scene using Phaser.</li>
								<li>Sending attack / defense commands to and from any player controlled territory to another player / non-player controlled territory.</li>
								<li>Change scene between Start menu and game session.</li>
								<li>Each territory generates points and units, which determine the player's score. The player with the highest score wins.</li>
								<li>Power-ups to boost player owned territories. </li>
								<li>Looped background music.</li>
								<li>Background canvas / image</li>
								<li>Balancing & placement of territories</li>
							</ul>

							<p>
								<li><h3>Database:</h3></li>
									<ul style = "list-style-type:disc;">
										<li>Due to the simplicity of the game, there was no need for a database.</li>
									</ul>
							</p>

							<li><h3>Multiplayer:</h3></li>
								<ul style = "list-style-type:disc;">
									<li>A client-server multiplayer approach was adopted for Super-Enigma. By adopting a client-server multiplayer strategy, some or all game data
									can be stored centrally and controlled centrally, which can help discourage players from performing client sided cheating to gain an extra edge during game-play.</li>
								</ul>

							<p>
								<li><h3>Design-pattern:</h3></li>
								<ul style = "list-style-type:disc;">
									<li>Singleton-esque patterns were used to manage game-systems</li>
									<li>Visitor patterns were used to send current context to function calls.</li>
									<li>Observer patterns were used to manage multiplayer callbacks.</li>
								</ul>
							</p>

							<li><h3>Modularity:</h3></li>
							<ul style = "list-style-type:disc;">
								<li>No modularity per say was introduced to Super-Enigma. As the software was built using Javascript, the code was written in a functional programming-esque manner.
								Which consequently meant that there was no OOP school of thought applied. The closest Super-Enigma comes to modularity is how the server and data flows through different
								"modules" i.e functions that specialize in taking care of specific tasks. </li>
							</ul>

	         <h2>Game-play / game mechanics / game control<span>.</span></h2>
	         	<p>
					The game will be played out using a mixture of mouse and keyboard controls and will encourage the player to be strategic with their unit placement and territory acquisition.
					The mouse will be used to interact with the different territories, to give unit instructions and to use skills to power-up territories.
					The territory unit count will increase every game tick as will the players points. Therefore, players will be encouraged to react fast,
					or slow depending on the desired outcome for the player.
				</p>

				<p>
					Units produced by player territories can be spent to utilize temporary power-up boosts to any of the players territory. Boosts can vary between increased unit
					production or increased movement to give the players defense or attack an extra edge. Each territory boost can be upgraded over several tiers in return for units.
					The cost of territory boots is shared globally per player and increases each time the players territory is upgraded.
					Territory boosts will be lost when the territory is lost to another player.
				</p>

				<p>
					Unit count on territories tick up every game tick. Units can be sent to defend, attack and acquire new territory for the player.
					When movement orders are given to a territory, half the units in the territory will be given the order and the instruction will be carried out immediately.
					One territory can perform multiple instructions provided it's not towards the same territory and there is no territory blocking the path.
					For example: Territory A has sent instructions to attack territory B and C.
					However, Territory A cannot send extra troops to attack territory B until the previous attack instruction is completed.
				</p>

				<p>
					Units that have received an attack / defend order will move to the selected territory. Depending on the distance from the units territory of origin to the final destination,
					the time it takes for the instruction to be carried out may be longer. Units that attack a defended territory will lose troop counts on an 1 to 1 basis, i.e equal to the troops defending.
					For example: An attacking territory sends 200 units to a defending territory with 150 units. After the attack instruction is completed the territory is won by the attacking player
					and 50 units remain to defend the newly acquired territory.

				<p>
				    The total number of units a territory can hold before it stops producing new ones is 5,000. If the territory exceeds 5,000 units, the unit production on the
					territory will be paused until the total unit count on the territory is less than 5,000. Unit counts can however increase past 5,000 by reinforcing the territory using units
					from other territories.
				</p>
				</p>

				<p>
					Players can join whenever they want, however players can only participate by taking over a territory that is not acquired by any player.
					If there is no available territory, the player can only observe. As soon as all the territory on the map is acquired by a single player, the player wins.
